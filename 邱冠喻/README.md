Simple Rails and jQuery Homework
==========

I ... implement `jquery` homework in a rails project, to run this thing

```
cd <this_project>
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive
```

and init the rails project

```
cd <this_folder>/homework
bundle
rake db:migrate
```

then it **should** be able to run

```
rails s
```

open the browser, there is an index page in this project with some link above the page, click the `jquery_homework` and this is my homework.  

The result is very different from the original assignment ... I know XDD.
